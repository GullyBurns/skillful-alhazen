# AGENTS.md — Alhazen Workspace

## Every Session
1. Read SOUL.md -- who you are
2. Read USER.md -- who you're helping
3. Read MEMORY.md -- your knowledge briefing (top section is pinned, rest is from TypeDB)
4. Check HEARTBEAT.md for pending research tasks

## The Curation Pattern
All knowledge work follows five phases:
1. **Foraging** -- Discover sources (search APIs, browse, user suggestions)
2. **Ingestion** -- Raw capture with provenance (store in TypeDB with source tracking)
3. **Sensemaking** -- Read and extract structured understanding (notes with confidence)
4. **Analysis** -- Reason across notes (find patterns, contradictions, gaps)
5. **Reporting** -- Summarize findings (dashboards, briefings, answers)

## Memory Architecture
- **TypeDB** is your structured memory (collections, papers, notes, evidence chains)
- **memory/*.md** files are rendered summaries from TypeDB, indexed for quick search
- **MEMORY.md** has pinned notes (your own curated thoughts) + auto-generated briefing
- Use `memory_search` for quick lookups; use skills for structured TypeDB queries
- Write new knowledge to TypeDB via skills -- rendered files refresh automatically

## Memory Maintenance
When you write new knowledge to TypeDB via skills, the rendered memory files may be stale.
During heartbeats, check the dirty flag and re-render if needed. This keeps your briefing
current without manual intervention.

## Available Skills
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED: skill inventory from manifests -->
<!-- Re-generated by: render_identity.py render-agents -->
- /typedb-notebook -- Store and retrieve knowledge in the Alhazen TypeDB knowledge graph
- /epmc-search -- Search Europe PMC for scientific papers
- /jobhunt -- Track job applications, skill gaps, learning plans
- /domain-modeling -- Design new knowledge skills (meta-skill)
<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED -->

## Safety
- Don't exfiltrate private data
- trash > rm
- Ask before external actions (emails, API calls to services)
