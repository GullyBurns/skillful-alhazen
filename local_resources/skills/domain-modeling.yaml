# Meta-skill pattern
skill_type: meta
purpose: "Teaches how to build domain-specific skills following the curation pattern"

# Curation workflow phases
curation_phases:
  foraging:
    description: "Discovering sources worth capturing"
    examples:
      - "Job boards, company pages (job hunting)"
      - "PubMed, citation chains (literature review)"
      - "RSS feeds, social media (news investigation)"
  
  ingestion:
    description: "Raw capture with provenance"
    properties:
      - provenance
      - immutability
      - completeness
    script_responsibility: "Fetch and store raw content - NO parsing or interpretation"
  
  sensemaking:
    description: "Claude reads and extracts structured understanding"
    subtasks:
      - parsing
      - entity_extraction
      - relation_extraction
      - classification
      - summarization
      - gap_analysis
      - inference
    output: "Fragments, Notes, Relations"
  
  analysis:
    description: "Reasoning across many notes over time"
    examples:
      - "What skills appear most frequently across positions?"
      - "How does this company compare to others?"
    output: "Synthesis notes"
  
  reporting:
    description: "Dashboard views for human decision-making"
    components:
      - pipeline_views
      - comparison_matrices
      - progress_tracking
      - alerts
      - deep_dives

# TypeDB entity mapping
entity_mapping:
  thing: "Primary items you track (Company, Paper, etc.)"
  artifact: "Raw captured content (Job Description, PDF, etc.)"
  fragment: "Extracted pieces (Requirement, Claim, etc.)"
  note: "Claude's analysis (Fit Analysis, Critique, etc.)"

# Design principles
design_principles:
  separation_of_concerns:
    scripts: ["Fetch/store raw content", "Query TypeDB", "Return data for Claude"]
    claude: ["Read artifacts", "Extract entities", "Create notes", "Reason across data"]
  dashboard_design:
    - "Query the graph - don't duplicate data"
    - "Pipeline views - show entities moving through states"
    - "Matrix views - compare across dimensions"
    - "Progress tracking - show plan completion"
    - "Deep dives - all context about an entity"

# When to create new domain
create_when:
  - "Specific information type to track"
  - "Discoverable sources (APIs, URLs, databases)"
  - "Need to reason over time"
  - "Structure matters - entities have attributes/relationships"
  - "Want Claude to build understanding through sensemaking"

dont_create_for:
  - "Simple lookups (use web search)"
  - "One-time questions (just ask)"
  - "Unstructured brainstorming (use notes)"
